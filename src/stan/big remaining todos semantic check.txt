sort out clashes between math library and user identifiers:
Variable names will conflict with the names of predefined functions other than constants.
Thus a variable may not be named logit or add, but it may be named pi or
e.
Variable names will also conflict with the names of distributions suffixed with
_lpdf, _lpmf, _lcdf, and _lccdf, _cdf, and _ccdf, such as normal_lcdf_log; this
also holds for the deprecated forms _log, _cdf_log, and _ccdf_log,
Using any of these variable names causes the stanc translator to halt and report
the name and location of the variable causing the conflict.

check data only arguments

go through all bad examples to make sure they all fail (including ones that are currently not in folder)
