sort out clashes between math library and user identifiers:
Variable names will conflict with the names of predefined functions other than constants.
Thus a variable may not be named logit or add, but it may be named pi or
e.
Variable names will also conflict with the names of distributions suffixed with
_lpdf, _lpmf, _lcdf, and _lccdf, _cdf, and _ccdf, such as normal_lcdf_log; this
also holds for the deprecated forms _log, _cdf_log, and _ccdf_log,
Using any of these variable names causes the stanc translator to halt and report
the name and location of the variable causing the conflict.
i.e. when calling a function/dereferencing an identifier, we first try the user defined ones; only then the primitives
conversely, when adding an identifier to the var map, we first check that it does not clash with a non-constant primitive; then that it does not clash with something that's already in the var map.
note that redefining the function e() with precisely the same signature is still not allowed.
add in the clashes with the suffixes above.

check data only arguments

go through all bad examples to make sure they all fail (including ones that are currently not in folder)
